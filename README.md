# recommendation_system
This project was created by taking up the Netflix Challenge, which aimed to propose a better recommendation system by solving a matrix completion problem.

You can choose either to solve the problem with the Alternating Least Squares method (ALS_netflix) or with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD_netflix).
The ALS is relatively fast to compute compared to the SGD, but gives a higher RMSE.
If you use the SGD with the Netflix dataset you will need a GPU or a cloud service.
